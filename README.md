# Elonet downloader

A simple tool for downloading videos from Elonet archives.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/Tronic/elonet-dl.git
python -m elonet-dl
```

Use `pip3` and `python3` instead if necessary. Optionally, URL may be given as argument, otherwise the program will ask it on startup.

Fetches video chunks and losslessly remuxes them into MP4 format.

Only very minimally tested but seems to work.
